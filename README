This is my personal module that I pass around from place to place. It can't
really work as a channel or option-presenting module of its own, as half the
point is to allow your imports to be a bit more dynamic, which it achieves by
only depending on lib, the one constant in the fixed point outside of extraArgs.

Basic usage is:

    imports = [ (import ./dyn {}) ];
    
in configuration.nix. Now, everything in your configuration directory, except
obvious items like {darwin-,}configuration.nix, is automatically discovered
and imported, with its lib argument augmented with `mylib`. Further
documentation forthcoming.

The intended contents of the primary and secondary paths are *personally* 
universal and *personally* site-specific, respectively -- certainly do not view
the primary as set in stone; hack away.

This whole thing came out of the seeming inability to set the contents of
extraArgs without resorting to flakes or using wrapped/modified versions of
the various rebuild scripts. In truth, once flakes hit stable and become less
of a pain to use, this sort of solution should be considered obsolete.
